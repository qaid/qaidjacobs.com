  "description": "Mortgage Music - as if I was peering years into the future and predicting the need for some healing because of the predatory loaning that has been hatched on the people. I wasn't though. I just remember getting inspired one day back in the lab (2002) to rock a little house from the High School days. It came off ok - a few hiccups here and there, sound a little too hot in a couple of spots, but overall, you can nod your head to it. I plugged the Numark directly into the desktop PC with some Radioshack RCA to mini-stereo plugs strung together with Radioshack connectors, so don't be surprised at the hum you'll hear in the tender moments. It probably wouldn't be noticeable if I hadn't mentioned it. Sorry. I had to do a little bit of re-constructive rework to reproduce this track as a single file to be streamed.",
