# Motion and Memory

There's a question I've been carrying: *What did they carry when they left?*

Not just the physical things—the trunks and suitcases, the photographs wrapped in cloth. But the intangible cargo. The music, the way of speaking, the recipes that couldn't be written down. The Great Migration wasn't just a movement of bodies from South to North. It was a transmission of culture under pressure, a preservation act disguised as an escape.

I think about this because I'm in motion too. Not the same motion, not the same pressures. But motion nonetheless. From place to place, carrying things I can't always name. Some inherited, some chosen, some just accumulated along the way.

## What gets lost in translation

When you move, you become a translator. Not just of language, but of context. Things that made sense in one place require explanation in another. The music you grew up with becomes "your taste." The food becomes "ethnic cuisine." Even the way you move through space—the pace, the proximity, the eye contact—all of it suddenly has to be justified or adjusted.

And in that translation, something always slips through the cracks. Not lost exactly, but transformed. Like a photograph of a photograph of a photograph. Each generation a little more abstracted from the source, a little more filtered through the medium of the present.

## The question persists

So what did they carry? And what am I carrying now?

I don't have complete answers. But I have fragments:

- The records. Thousands of them, spread across cities, some I haven't seen in years. Each one a captured moment, a way of moving through time that I can return to.
- The questions themselves. The need to ask *why* and *how* and *what if*. The refusal to let things just be what they appear to be on the surface.
- The motion. This restlessness. This need to keep discovering, to stay uncomfortable, to resist settling into a single story.

Maybe that's the inheritance. Not the answers, but the questions. Not the destination, but the practice of moving.
