  "description": "HBO has produced a movie adaptation of the theatrical adaptation of the amazing work from Ta-Nehisi Coates, Between the World and Me. To support the movie and explore the themes presented in the the book and the movie, the teams at SpokeMedia and Domino Sound have produced an official podcast companion to the movie. My son Sekani is featured in the opening, and then he and I team up towards the end of the episode (48:19) when I read a personal letter to him.",
